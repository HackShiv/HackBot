# About alonelyhacker
A simple hackingbot for terminal usage (Able to learn and adapt to users). 
This is based off from the langauge model Mistral AI that intergrates its POST requests from WormGPT.
I created this for bug hunters and security researchers although anyone can use it really.

# Usage:
python3 alonelyhacker.py

(It will also create a friendship_history.json dump file to store and load the conversation for memory of the user, you can delete this file manually, it'll be created again after usage)

# My next steps with this little side project
- Directory and Files Integration with VirusTotal scan option (If I do manage to pull this off, it'd be a great win for me personally)
- Ability to create different files with the AI based on output (.txt, .exe, .sh, .doc, etc) - So for example "user: Give me some XSS, I can use on a website > XSSpayloads.txt" (Ofc this is simplified and I might have to add flags probably)
- Make it the most more humanlike???? (Impossible, or is it?) :0

Feel free to use it, inspect the code, play with it, feedback or help you are interested, really, that'd be much appreciated :)
