# About HackBot
A simple hackingbot for terminal usage (Able to learn and adapt from users). 
This is based off from the langauge model Mistral AI that intergrates its API requests from Unofficial WormGPT.

I created this for bug hunters and security researchers although anyone can use it really.

# Usage:
python3 hackbot.py

(It will also create a friendship_history.json dump file to store and load the conversation for memory of the user, you can delete this file manually, it'll be created again after usage)

# My next steps with this little side project
- Directory and Files Read/Write Integration with VirusTotal scan option (If I do manage to pull this off, it'd be a great win for me personally)
- Ability to create different files with the AI based on output (.txt, .exe, .sh, .doc, etc) - So for example "user: Give me some XSS, I can use on a website > XSSpayloads.txt" (Ofc this is simplified and I might have to add flags probably)
- Make it the most and more humanlike???? (Impossible, or is it?) :0

Feel free to use it, inspect the code, play with it, feedback or help you are interested, really, that'd be much appreciated. (Also star my repo if you find it useful)
