# About HackBot - (No longer maintained)
A simple hackingbot for terminal usage (Able to learn and adapt from users). 
This is based off from the langauge model Mistral AI that intergrates its API requests from Unofficial WormGPT.

I created this for bug hunters and security researchers although anyone can use it really.

# Usage:
python3 hackbot.py

(It will also create a friendship_history.json dump file to store and load the conversation for memory of the user, you can delete this file manually, it'll be created again after usage)
